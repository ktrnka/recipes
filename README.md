After discovering a bunch of poorly-formatted recipes in Google Drive I figured I'd give Github a shot.

Advantages vs Google Drive

- Easy to auto-publish so I can share with people
- Easy integration with Copilot for reformatting and rephrasing

Disadvantages vs Google Drive

- Hard to edit on mobile
- It's public, which could be dubious if any recipes are copy/pasted from the web
- It's not as clear where to best put notes when I'm learning a recipe

# In progress

# TODO

## Recipe measurement improvements

### Need weight measurements added:
- **naan.md**: Add weights for water (1/2 c = ~114g), flour (~2 c)
- **choux.md**: Add weight for water (1/2 c = ~114g)
- **kouign-amann.md**: Add weights for water (1 cup = ~227g), butter (3 tbsp = ~42g), sugar (~1 cup)
- **All sweet cookie recipes** (lower priority - easier to measure by volume):
  - chocolate-chip-cookies.md
  - peanut-butter-cookies.md
  - shortbread-cookies.md
  - snickerdoodles.md
  - biscotti.md
  - brownie-cookies.md
  - butter-horns.md

### Need volume measurements added (lower priority):
- **burger_buns.md**: Add volume equivalents for water/milk (89g = ~6 tbsp)

### Need specific corrections:
- **hazelnut-cookies.md**: 
  - Verify hazelnut conversion (1 lb = 2 cups seems wrong for ground nuts)
  - Add cup measurement for butter (3/4 lb = ~1.5 cups or 3 sticks)

### Vague/incomplete measurements:
- **broccoli-cheese-soup.md**: No measurements at all, just ingredient names
- **monkey-bread.md**: Vague amounts ("Brown sugar", "Sugar" without quantities)

## Other TODOs
- Ensure that more recipes have volume measurements if I'm traveling without a scale
- Copy more of my old notes over
- Dark mode to save battery

## Bugs
- The checkbox-list doesn't work properly with nested lists. It just joins the nested items into the parent item without a li element or label+input type item
