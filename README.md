After discovering a bunch of poorly-formatted recipes in Google Drive I figured I'd give Github a shot.

Advantages vs Google Drive

- Easy to auto-publish so I can share with people
- Easy integration with Copilot for reformatting and rephrasing

Disadvantages vs Google Drive

- Hard to edit on mobile
- It's public, which could be dubious if any recipes are copy/pasted from the web
- It's not as clear where to best put notes when I'm learning a recipe
