After discovering a bunch of poorly-formatted recipes in Google Drive I figured I'd give Github a shot.

Advantages vs Google Drive

- Easy to auto-publish so I can share with people
- Easy integration with Copilot for reformatting and rephrasing

Disadvantages vs Google Drive

- Hard to edit on mobile
- It's public, which could be dubious if any recipes are copy/pasted from the web
- It's not as clear where to best put notes when I'm learning a recipe

# In progress
- Add a cook-mode toggle to keep my screen from sleeping (though I should probably also add a dark mode to save battery too)

# TODO
- Add checkboxes so I can check off ingredients as I add them. It'd be nice if I could do this as a sort of UL styling
- Ensure that more recipes have volume measurements if I'm traveling without a scale.
- Copy more of my old notes over
