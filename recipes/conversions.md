[Note on egg yolks from Rose](https://www.realbakingwithrose.com/baking-tips/2019/1/16/now-we-are-separating-and-weighing-out-egg-yolks-and-whites-ad25y):
> When Rose wrote The Bread Bible in 2003, an average large egg’s yolk weighed 18.6 grams and its whites weighed 31.4 grams. We are now seeing yolks ranging from as low as 12 grams (and rarely as high as 19 grams), and thus usually an increase in whites per whole egg
