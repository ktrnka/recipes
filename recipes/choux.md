# Choux
Adapted from Claire Saffitz, Smitten Kitchen

## Ingredients

<div class="ingredients" markdown="1">
- 1/2 c water (or mix with milk)
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 2 tsp sugar
- 45g unsalted butter
- 67g flour
- 2 eggs
</div>

<cook-mode-toggle></cook-mode-toggle>

## Steps
- Bring the water, salt, sugar, butter to a simmer
- Add flour, stirring aggressively until it transforms (a minute or two?)
- Set aside, cool a bit
- Beat eggs, add them to the paste, whisk aggressively until it comes together, switch from whisk back to spoon/spatula
- Pipe it onto a tray
- Use the leftover beaten egg with some milk to make an egg wash. Apply with your fingers while pushing the peaks down
- Bake at 400 for 25-35 minutes

## Variations
- Add 5 oz cheese into the batter, preferably with a fine grater

## Tips / notes
- When adding cheese, it thickens a bit much which I think affected the texture (didn't get the huge internal bubble)

## Related: Whipped cream
- 1 c heavy cream or whipping cream
- 2 tbsp fine sugar
- 1/2 tsp vanilla
