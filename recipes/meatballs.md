## Steps
1. Mix ingredients.
2. Cook in oven for a while.
    - For golf-ball-sized meatballs: 400 F for about 20 min

## If you're low on bread crumbs but have old bread or bread crusts

- Chop them
- Bake at 250-300 F for 10-15 min
- Put them in a bag then hit with a rolling pin to break them up

## For freezing

- Cook as normal, stopping maybe a minute early, let them cool a bit, then use zip lock bags for the portions you want, then put them in the freezer
