# Mesir wat

## Ingredients
- Bloom:
    - 3 tbsp butter
    - 1 large onion, chopped
    - 3 cloves garlic, minced
    - 3+ tbsp tomato paste
    - 2+ tbsp berbere spice mix
- Simmer, 40 minutes:
    - 1 cup lentils
    - 2.5 cups water, vegetable broth, or chicken broth
    - 1 tsp salt
    - 1 tbsp butter

## Tips
- Red lentils are traditional but other types are cheaper and they come out fine.
- For special occassions, make niter kibbeh (Ethiopian spiced butter) to use instead of regular butter.
- I usually serve with naan, but you can make injera at home too.
