# Chili

## Ingredients

- 1 lb ground beef
- 1 big onion, like yellow or white, diced
- 3-5 cloves of garlic, diced
- 1 can tomato sauce
- 1 can diced tomatoes - I like petite diced
- 2 cans beans - I usually do 1 pinto and 1 kidney. Sometimes I use "chili beans" or whatever the store has
- 3 tablespoons chili powder

### Other spices to taste, these are what I use:

- Important spices
    - onion powder
    - salt
- Optional / to taste
    - garlic powder
    - ground pepper
    - cayenne
    - aleppo pepper flakes
    - ghost chili flakes
    - urfa biber flakes
    - (really just a bunch of different peppers in there to develop a more complex flavor)

## Steps

1. Brown the ground beef with the onion and garlic - try to get a little char on the beef for more flavor. Drain if you need to.
2. Mix everything in slow cooker and cook on low for like 4 hours.
3. Taste it and adjust the spiciness, saltiness, etc.
    - If it’s not spicy enough and you have time, add pepper flakes and let it cook like 30 min or so.
    - If it’s not spicy enough and you don’t have time, add cayenne.
    - If it’s too spicy, serve with chips and cheese.
    - If it’s bland, probably you’re lacking salt.
    - If it’s too salty, you’re screwed so be cautious with salt.
    - If the taste seems hollow or too much tomato, add more chili powder and/or onion powder.

## Tips
- After browning the meat, you can deglaze the pan with a little water and let that reduce a touch. Then add that into the chili to make it more meaty. It also helps with cleaning the pan.
- The brand of chili powder can have a big effect. If you’re having trouble with flavor try a different brand.
- If it’s too watery, take the lid off for the last hour or so.
