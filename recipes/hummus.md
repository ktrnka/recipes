# Hummus

## Ingredients
- 1 cup dried chickpeas, soaked overnight with 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 180g tahini
- 6 tbsp lemon juice
- 4-6 cloves of garlic
- 1 tsp cumin
- salt and pepper to taste
- cayenne to taste
- 1/4 c water (adapt to get the texture you want)

## Steps

### Part 1: Cook the chickpeas
- Soak the chickpeas overnight
- Drain
- Boil in water with another 1/2 tsp baking soda for 30 minutes, skimming the foam from the top occasionally
- Add salt, boil another 15 minutes
- Drain and rinse with cool water

### Part 2: Hummus
- Dump everything into the tupperware you'll use for storage
- Potato ricer for chickpeas to get them extra smooth
- Blend

## Tips
- Cayenne works better than other peppers to diffuse the heat throughout this recipe
- The chickpea leftovers and such form a sort of glue that tends to gunk up everything
