# Pizza

## TODO
- Add more exact measurements for people that measure

## Pizza dough

### Ingredients
- 1 1/4 c water
- 1 tsp yeast
- bread flour until it's not tacky
- 2 tsp salt

### Steps
1. Mix ingredients, stopping when it's a shaggy dough
2. Knead, adding flour to touch
3. Separate into 4 pieces, then shape those into balls with reasonable surface tension
4. Store in containers with a little olive oil, with any seams down
5. Let it cold ferment in the fridge at least 1 day, preferably 3-5 days. The flavor will get better

### Variations
- Ingredient variations:
    - Up to 1/4 c olive oil (reduce water to compensate): Supposedly it helps crisp up. Also gives flavor.
    - Up to 1/4 c semolina (reduce flour to compensate): Adds a little flavor
    - Some starter: If you need the dough sooner this can get the flavor ready sooner
    - Parmagiano reggiano: Add just a little on top before the bake for some zing

## Fancy pizza
This one depends significantly on your baking setup.

### Fancy toaster oven / convection
1. Preheat the oven to 480 F or so, convection on, rack on low
2. Stretch out the pizza ball over semolina, then transfer to a pizza pan. When you stretch it out, don't press down on the crust part. I like to make sure the crust is airy. Ways to achieve that:
    - Initially press down in a ring just inside the crust then you can pull gently from the underside while turning. Alternatively, if it's not sticking to the surface at all you can turn and press outwards while you turn
3. Bake for ~10 min. You should get some small dark spots and stop then

### Pizza stone and regular oven
1. Preheat the oven to 450-500 F. Let the stone preheat for like 30 minutes or so
2. Options:
    1. Put it on parchment paper on a pizza peel and slide it in that way
    2. Semolina on a pizza peel. This takes some practice to be able to slide it onto the stone without it sticking
3. Bake for ~12 min. The crust should turn golden

## Focaccia pizza / detroit-ish
1. Coat the inside of a loaf pan in olive oil. Make sure it coats all surfaces, even if the pan feels nonstick-ish
2. Put a dough ball in and stretch it to fill the bottom of the pan
3. Let it rise, covered, for 60+ minutes
4. Sauce & cheese. Low-moisture mozz is better than fancy mozz for this one. If your pan is nonstick enough, you can have the cheese touch the side of the pan for crispy edges. If not, avoid at all costs because it's a huge pain to clean
5. Bake at maybe 375 for 18 min or so

### Tips
- Longer proof = more airy crust

## Cast iron pizza
I forget the specifics... I was inspired by Kenji's video below. The nice thing is that cast iron is easy to clean.

If I remember correctly, the main challenge is getting both the top and bottom of the pizza to cook properly. So I'd cook on the stovetop at first for a couple of minutes to get the bottom hot, then transfer to the oven to heat all the way through.

## Notes
- After you take it out, let it cool on a wire rack for 2-4 min before cutting. This helps keep the bottom of the crust crispy. If instead you put it directly on a cutting board, the bottom of the crust will steam itself and can get soggy
- Bread flour will help it stretch without ripping
- You can make your own sauce but I don't think it's worth it compared to a can of decent, plain tomato sauce. To make it yourself, blend a can of San Manzano whole peeled tomatoes, and then if it's thin you can reduce it in a pan to the thickness you like.
- When using fresh mozzarella, I prefer to rip it into pieces rather than cutting coins. I think I got this from Bon Appetit
- For neapolitan pizza, it's a good sign if you get lots of micro bubbles on the crust
