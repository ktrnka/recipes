# Notes from various recipes

## [Cinnamon rolls](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/overnight-cinnamon-rolls/)
These came out great! Letting it rise for long enough made the texture really fluffy.

If I could do it again I might add a touch more cinnamon or maybe try a less strong cream cheese than Philadelphia so that the cheese flavor doesn't overpower the cinnamon flavor. I might also try more flavoring like nutmeg or ginger.

### Ingredients

- 200g flour (1 2/3 cups)
- 10g sugar (2 tsp)
- 3g yeast (1 tsp)
- 2g salt (1/2 tsp)
- 5g vegetable oil (1 tsp)
- 110g water or milk (1/c cup)

### Fillings tried
- Cranberry sauce and sweet potato filling (TODO: copy from ChatGPT). This turned out well
- Mushroom and onion. This didn't turn out well
- Leftover green bean casserole. This turned out great! But I didn't have the time to freeze it so shaping was difficult
- Leftover turkey, gravy, and mashed potato. This turned out ok but the flavors weren't very strong

It's best if you freeze or harden the filling somehow, and the filling should be something with a strong flavor.

### Steps
- Bloom, mix, knead, rise until doubled.
- Separate into about 8 equal pieces, then pre-shape into balls
- Shape with a rolling pin into circles. If possible, you want a slight convex/lens shape with thinner edges
- Fold the dumpling wrappers around the filling, let rest a bit (can find videos on Youtube for shaping)
- Heat a little oil in a pan on medium or medium-high. Cook the bottoms for 1-2 min, then add 1/4 cup of water and put a lid on to steam them for 4-5 minutes, then cook without the lid for about a minute to re-crisp the bottoms
- Cool on a cooling rack so that the bottoms don't lose the crisp

## [Dinner rolls](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/japanese-milk-bread-rolls-recipe)
These turned out great, though I made some adjustments:
- Didn't use eggs in the dough or the wash
- Used milk wash
- On the best one, I used a little starter too and had the first rise going overnight to develop flavor and save time

The tangzhong method is okay. One nice thing is that I can use it to melt or soften the butter, which also brings down the paste temperature. But the pot was always a bit annoying to clean because it doesn't break down in water easily. I think it made the dough a little easier to handle than I'd normally expect though.
