# Hamburger buns for one

One of the problems with hamburger bun recipes is that they're meant to make a lot, and it's annoying to use half of an egg in a downsized recipe. This one came from ChatGPT with modifications based on my setup

Typically burger buns are 50-60% hydration and are enriched doughs.

# Ingredients

- 142g flour
- 89g water or milk. If using milk, don't use a lot
- 10g oil
- 6g sugar
- 4g salt
- 1-2g yeast

Makes 2 buns (125-130g pre-bake)

## Variations

- 20-30g of starter, just offset the flour and water accordingly. I'm lazy about my calculations and just assume it's 100% hydration starter even though it isn't, and I don't offset my yeast by much

# Steps
- Mix and knead like a regular dough. Rise until about doubled
- Split into two, stretch it out a little, fold into the center, then roll into balls.
- Let rest for 10 minutes or so then squish them flat. Resting is needed to relax the gluten after handling
- I proof for about an hour at 100 F
- Bake at 380 for about 20 minutes

# TODO
- The hydration amount sounds wrong, given the actual recipe
