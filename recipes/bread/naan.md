# Naan
Adapted from [Food Wishes](https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2019/02/garlic-naan-now-100-tandoor-free.html)

## Ingredients
- 1/2 c water
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp yeast
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp butter or oil
- Half a plain yogurt
- About 2 c flour

## Steps
- Bloom the yeast with water and sugar, wait 5 min
- Add the rest of the stuff
- Let rise a couple of hours, then divide into 4 balls
- Flatten each with a rolling pin until pretty thin
- Cook on a hot cast iron - for me, setting 7 on the medium sized burner works. It helps to cover it while cooking.

## Adjustments
- Yogurt: If plain isn't available, lemon or lime works well
