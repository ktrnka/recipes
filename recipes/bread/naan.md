# Naan

Makes 4-6 naan

Adapted from [Food Wishes](https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2019/02/garlic-naan-now-100-tandoor-free.html)

## Ingredients
- 1/2 c water
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp yeast
- 1 tsp salt
- About 1 tbsp oil (butter is ok too if melted, softened, or grated)
- Half a plain yogurt (About 3 oz or 85g)
- About 2 c flour

## Steps

### Dough
- Bloom the yeast with water and sugar (mix and wait 5 min)
- Add the rest of the stuff, mixing well, then kneading
- Divide into 4 balls and let them rise

### Cooking
- Flatten each with a rolling pin until pretty thin
- Cook on a hot cast iron - for me, setting 7 on the medium sized burner works. It helps to cover it while cooking. It only takes a minute or so per side.

## Adjustments
- Yogurt: If plain isn't available, lemon or lime works well
