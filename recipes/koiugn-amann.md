# Kouignette (mini Koiugn Amann)
Adapted from Claire Saffitz

## Ingredients

### Dough
- 1 cup room temp water
- 423g flour
- 3 tbsp melted, cooled butter
- 1 1/2 tsp salt (5g)
- 1 tsp yeast
- 1/4 cups sugar

### Butter block
- 3 sticks salted butter (340g)

### Other
- About 1 cup sugar in the lamination and pan
- ~2 tbsp butter to brush the pan

## Steps
- Make the dough, let it double (preferably cold ferment for flavor)
- Make a 7x7" butter square
- Roll the dough into a square that can include the butter square rotated 45 degrees
- Fold it into a packet
- 2 folds, then refrigerate 1 hour, then 2 more folds (this time including the flour)
- Roll out to 12x18, cut into 3x3 squares (small muffin tin) or 6x6 squares (big muffin tin)
- Shape into pan, let rise (preferably cold ferment)
- Bake at 350 for 30-40 min. Check every 10 min, rotate, etc

## Failings, tips
- The size of the squares needs to be proportional to the size of the tin. If it's too small, they'll just flatten into squares
- Cheese grater for hard butter. Mark the 7x7 on the wax/parchment paper and shape to that
- Pizza wheel for cutting the dough, trimming the dough edges to make it more rectangular
- Butter the pan, dust heavily with sugar, shake, invert to get the excess out
- Dislodge them from the pan immediately with chopsticks. Remove after 2-4 min once they've firmed up a bit
- Cool inverted on a wire rack
- Exercise a lot
