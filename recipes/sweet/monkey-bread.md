## Steps
1. Melt butter in one bowl.
2. Mix dry ingredients in another bowl.
3. Butter a pan (a deep pan is best, like a bundt pan).
4. Cut each biscuit dough piece into quarters, coat in butter, roll in dry mix, and place into pan.
5. Bake at 375°F until it's cooked (you can sort of do the fork test).
