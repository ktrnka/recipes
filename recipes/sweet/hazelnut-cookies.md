# Hazelnut Cookies

These are the ones grandma used to make! They're soft on the inside and crisp around the edges with a rich egg wash on top.

## Ingredients

### Dough

<div class="ingredients" markdown="1">
- 340g unsalted butter, softened (3/4 lb)
- 400g sugar (2 cups)
- 6g salt
- 130g 7 egg yolks
- 8-10g vanilla extract
- 250g ground hazelnuts or hazelnut meal (2 cups)
- 454g flour (3.5-4 cups)
- 65-80g milk if needed
</div>

### Egg wash

<div class="ingredients" markdown="1">
- 1 egg yolk
- 15g milk (1 tbsp)
</div>

## Steps

1. Blend all ingredients, with some egg in the cookies and some set aside (1-2 egg yolks set aside).
2. Chill for a while.
3. Cut cookies with cutters at about 1/8 inch thickness (maybe thicker to avoid burning).
4. Mix remaining egg yolk and some milk to form a glazing; baste cookie with the glazing.
5. Bake at 350°F for 12-14 minutes until the edges are just golden.

## Notes

- Dec 2025: I used too little flour and it was far too moist. They were hard to handle and flattened a lot. I added more flour in later batches and that was better but they were not sweet enough really, or that nutty.
