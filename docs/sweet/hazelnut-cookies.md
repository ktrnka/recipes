# Hazelnut Cookies

## Ingredients

- 1 lb ground hazelnuts (2 cups)
- 2 cups sugar
- 3/4 lb butter
- 1 lb flour (3 1/2 - 4 cups)
- 8 egg yolks
- A little milk (maybe 1/2 cup - 1 cup)

## Steps

1. Blend all ingredients, with some egg in the cookies and some set aside (1-2 egg yolks set aside).
2. Chill for a while.
3. Cut cookies with cutters at about 1/8" thickness (maybe thicker to avoid burning).
