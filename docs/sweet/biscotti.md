Ingredients
1c hazelnuts/filberts, chopped
1 tsp baking powder

2c flour
¾ c sugar
3 eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract
½ tsp almond extract

Toast nuts in oven - 10 min at 350 or until you smell them
Mix dry ingredients (except nuts)
Mix wet ingredients
Fold dry ingredients into wet
Add nuts
Roll into two 12 inch logs with your hands
Bake at 300 for 35-40 minutes.
Let cool for 10 min
Slice the logs at a bias about ½ to 1 inch thick
Cook the sliced biscotti 10 minutes
Turn them over
Cook another 10 minutes
Tips
Mix wet ingredients in a big bowl because you’ll add dry ingredients to them
You can mix dry ingredients in a bowl or even just put them all in a bag or tupperware and shake
For variations, choose different nuts and/or replace almond extract.  I’ve used pecans with rum extract and that was good
Slice the biscotti with a serrated knife
I use my finger to help measure the width of the pieces
Eat the end pieces and then people will wonder how you make the rest of them that shape
