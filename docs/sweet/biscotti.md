## Ingredients

- 1c hazelnuts (aka filberts), chopped
- 1 tsp baking powder
- pinch salt

- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp almond extract

4. Fold dry ingredients into wet.
5. Add nuts.
6. Roll into two 12-inch logs with your hands.
7. Bake at 300°F for 35-40 minutes.
8. Let cool for 10 minutes.
9. Slice the logs at a bias, about 1/2 inch thick.

## Tips

- Mix wet ingredients in a big bowl because you’ll add dry ingredients to them.
- For variations, choose different nuts and/or replace almond extract. Pecans with rum extract was good.
- Slice the biscotti with a serrated knife.
- I use my finger to help measure the width of the pieces.
- Eat the end pieces and then people will wonder how you make the rest of them that shape.
